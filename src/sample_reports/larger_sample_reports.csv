Report Impression
No evidence of acute disease.
Slight pulmonary vascular congestion without pulmonary edema or focal consolidation. Stable mild cardiomegaly.
No acute cardiopulmonary process.
No definite mass identified. Bibasilar opacities are likely atelectasis
"In comparison with the earlier study of this date, the nasogastric tube has been pushed forward so that the side port is below the level of the esophagogastric junction. Otherwise little change."
Increased bibasilar opacities could be due to aspiration or atelectasis.
"Probable, new right lower lobe pneumonia."
"As compared to ___ radiograph, right lower lobe opacity has nearly resolved, but a left lower lobe opacity has progressed. In a patient with a neurological condition, recurrent aspiration and or developing aspiration pneumonia should be considered. Exam is otherwise remarkable for removal of nasogastric tube and development of distended loops of bowel in the imaged upper abdomen, incompletely evaluated on this portable chest radiograph."
New heterogeneous opacification at the right lung base could be pneumonia or aspirated blood. Cardiomediastinal and hilar silhouettes and pleural surfaces are normal. Right PIC line ends in the low SVC. Nasogastric tube passes into the stomach and out of view.
"No relevant change as compared to the previous exam. The patient is rotated to the right, which slightly increases the radiodensity on the right side. No new focal parenchymal opacities. No pleural effusions. No pulmonary edema. Unchanged normal size of the cardiac silhouette."
1. Satisfactory position of endotracheal and enteric tubes. 2. The left internal jugular central venous line appears to be high in position and terminates in the internal jugular vein. 3. Small left pleural effusion is partially imaged.
NG tube tip isin the stomach. Cardiac size is normal. Right PICC tip is in the lower SVC. Visualized lungs are clear. Of note the upper portion of the chest was not included on the field of view.
"In comparison with the study of ___, the tip of the replaced nasogastric tube is in the mid portion of the stomach. However, the side port is at the level of the esophagogastric junction so that the tube should be pushed forward at least 5-7 cm for better positioning. The cardiac silhouette is within normal limits. Prominence of interstitial markings at the bases with Kerley lines are consistent with some elevation of pulmonary venous pressure. However, areas of possible coalescence at the bases could represent superimposed pneumonia in the appropriate clinical setting."
No significant interval change.
No acute intrathoracic process
No acute cardiopulmonary process.
No evidence of acute disease.
"1. No acute fracture is seen, but chest radiographs are insensitive for rib fractures. If there is high clinical concern for rib fracture, dedicated rib films would be recommended with the sites of tenderness to palpitation marked. 2. On the lateral view, the decending aorta is more prominent than on prior exams, which could represent a small aneursym at that level. Recommend correlation with clinical history and physical findings to assess the likelihood that the patient's fall was caused by this possible anuerysm or an associated acute dissection. These findings were communicated to Dr. ___ at 8:01 a.m. on ___ by phone."
No evidence of acute cardiopulmonary process.
Bibasilar atelectasis and upper zone redistribution. No CHF or frank consolidation. No gross effusion.
New left lower lobe opacity concerning for pneumonia or aspiration pneumonia. Improving right basal opacity. Bilateral pleural effusions. These findings were communicated via the radiology critical results dashboard at 12:57 p.m.
"No definite acute cardiopulmonary process. Bibasilar atelectasis. Vague opacities projecting over the left upper lung medially, potentially costochondral calcifications; however, dedicated chest x-ray with two views is suggested when patient is amenable."
Streaky bibasilar atelectasis. No focal consolidation to suggest pneumonia.
No acute cardiopulmonary process.
"No radiographic evidence of pneumonia or other acute cardiopulmonary abnormalities. Small nodular opacity described above is likely a spinous process tip in this projection, but cannot rule out a pulmonary nodule. Recommend oblique radiographs for further evaluation."
Heart size and mediastinum are stable. Lungs are slightly hyperinflated but essentially clear. There is no appreciable pleural effusion or pneumothorax. Nodule projecting over the left apex appears to be within the posterior aspect of the third ribs as demonstrated on the ___ view obtained and ___
"1. No acute cardiopulmonary processes. 2. Thickening of the cortex and trabecula of the left humerus, suggestive of Paget's disease. Dedicated humeral radiographs may be obtained for further evaluation."
No acute cardiopulmonary process.
"Bilateral small pleural effusions with lower lung atelectasis, less likely pneumonia."
"In comparison with the study of ___, the right IJ catheter remains in place. There is suggestion of lucency and opacity in the right supraclavicular region, which may well relate to material outside the patient. There are slightly better lung volumes. Central catheter again extends to the cavoatrial junction or upper right atrium. Bibasilar opacification, more prominent on the left, is consistent with atelectatic changes and small pleural effusion. No definite vascular congestion."
"Patient has been extubated, but lung volumes are unchanged and cardiomediastinal caliber is normal for the postoperative. . Previous pulmonary edema has resolved. No pneumothorax. Left pleural effusion is small."
"Normal chest radiograph; specifically, no evidence of pneumonia."
"PA and lateral chest compared to ___, read in conjunction with imaging of the chest on an abdomen CT performed earlier today and reported separately. Small bilateral pleural effusions are essentially unchanged. Lungs are well expanded and clear. Normal cardiomediastinal and hilar silhouettes. No free subdiaphragmatic gas. Healed right mid rib fracture."
No acute cardiopulmonary abnormality.
"As on the previous image, several millimetric metallic particles are seen. The biggest of these particles projects over the region of the right atrium on the frontal image. Another particles appears to be located in the lingular. 2 additional barely visible particles with diameters be low 1 mm project over the left lung bases and are not clearly visualized on the previous cross-table image. No other change, no pneumothorax."
No acute intrathoracic process. No visualized food products.
"As compared to the previous radiograph, the previously placed right pigtail catheter has been removed. There is a minimal decrease in extent of the known right pneumothorax. Right basilar atelectasis, however, persists. The pre-existing depression of the right hemidiaphragm is less severe than on the previous image. Unchanged appearance of the cardiac silhouette. Normal left hemithorax."
"As compared to the previous image, the position of the right chest tube is constant. There is no noticeable decrease in severity of the known right pneumothorax, account for not by depression of the right hemidiaphragm. The cardiac silhouette and the left lung is unchanged."
"As compared to the previous image, there is again an increase in extent and severity of the known right pneumothorax. The pneumothorax is now severe, with an average with of 3 cm throughout the right hemi thorax. There also is ongoing depression of the right hemidiaphragm. New is a larger right-sided pleural fluid level. Placement of a new chest tube should again be considered. Normal size of the heart. Unremarkable appearance of the left lung."
"Significant worsening opacification of the entire right hemithorax, suggesting re-expansion pulmonary edema in the setting of recent thoracentesis."
"As compared to the previous radiograph, the known right pneumothorax with depression of the right hemidiaphragm has not substantially changed. The relatively substantial pneumothorax has a diameter of close to 4 cm at the lung apex. The basal right lung is atelectatic. Unchanged appearance of the left lung. The right pigtail catheter in the pleural space is in unchanged position."
Previous large right pleural effusion has been replaced by a large pneumothorax and small pleural effusion. Interval shift of the mediastinum to the left suggests accumulation of air in the right pleural space under pressure. Heart size is normal. Left lung is clear.
"As compared to the previous image, there is virtually no change in appearance of the large fluidopneumothorax on the right, with mild depression of the right hemidiaphragm."
The the VP shunt is projecting over the right hemi thorax. Elevated right hemidiaphragm is present most likely increased in part due to subpulmonic effusion and atelectasis. Substantial portion of the right lower lung is still collapsed and substantial amount of pleural effusion is still present. No definitive pneumothorax is seen.
"In comparison with the study of ___, there is been a thoracentesis on the right with removal of a substantial amount of pleural fluid. No evidence of pneumothorax. A moderate right effusion persists with areas of underlying atelectasis and re-expansion pulmonary edema. The left lung is essentially clear."
"No focal consolidation, pneumothorax, or pleural effusion."
"Possible tiny, left apical pneumothorax. Bibasilar atelectasis, moderate left pleural effusion, and small right pleural effusion are essentially unchanged."
The previously placed left chest tube was removed. There is no radiographic evidence for the presence of a pneumothorax. Minimal atelectasis at the left lung basis. No larger pleural effusions. No pneumonia. The patient has also been extubated and the nasogastric tube was removed.
No acute cardiopulmonary process.
No evidence of acute disease.
